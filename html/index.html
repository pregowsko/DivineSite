								<h3>Aleksandra Stanek</h3>
								<span>Frontend Developer</span>
							</div>
							<div class="about_text">
								<p>Hi, my name is Aleksandra Stanek and I'm a junior frontend developer passionate about learning and developing new technologies while sharpening existing skills. Iâ€™ve spent most of my working hours for the last year developing high-performance websites, mobile applications and operating WordPress sites.</p>
								<p>As a frontend developer, I have a deep understanding of web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I use this knowledge to build intuitive and visually appealing user interfaces. I am experienced in creating responsive designs that work seamlessly on different devices and platforms.
								</p>
								<p>I am familiar with modern frontend frameworks such as React and Redux and I leverage these technologies to build complex, interactive applications that provide an excellent user experience. I am also skilled in using various frontend development tools such as Git, Webpack, and Babel to streamline my workflow and ensure that my code is efficient and maintainable.
								</p>
								<p>I go beyond to produce sites with focus on a unique look-and-feel, easily accessible, completely responsive and intuitive for users. By properly optimizing your pages and apps, I make sure they require little-to-no maintenance while still running on their own for years.

														<p>Creating websites is a multifaceted process that involves a combination of technical expertise, design skills, and attention to detail. A professional web developer must have a deep understanding of the latest web technologies, coding languages, and industry best practices.</p>
														<p>The process of creating your website typically begins with a comprehensive analysis of the client's needs, target audience, and goals for the website. This information is then used to create a site map and wireframe that outlines the site's structure, layout, and navigation.</p>
														<p>Once the site map and wireframe are approved, I will create a custom design that reflects your brand and vision for the website. This design will be refined through several rounds of revisions until it meets your satisfaction.</p>
														<p>After the design is finalized, I will begin the coding process using the latest coding languages and frameworks. This involves creating responsive layouts that work seamlessly across different devices and platforms, integrating multimedia content such as images and videos, and adding interactive features such as forms and animations.</p>
														<p>Throughout the development process, the website will be rigorously tested to ensure that it is optimized for speed, security, and accessibility. The final product will be thoroughly reviewed by the client and any necessary modifications will be made before the website is launched.</p>
														<p>In addition to designing and developing websites, I will also provide ongoing maintenance and support to ensure that your website remains up-to-date, secure, and fully functional. This may include performing regular backups, updating software and plugins, and providing technical support to users.</p>
														<p>Overall, creating a professional website requires a combination of technical expertise, creative design skills, and a deep understanding of the client's needs and goals. By working closely with you and employing the latest web technologies, I can create a website that not only meets but exceeds your expectations.</p>

												<p class="bigger">ChatGPT is a large language model developed by OpenAI that can be used for natural language processing tasks such as text generation and language translation. It is based on the GPT-3.5 (Generative Pretrained Transformer 3.5) model, which is one of the largest and most advanced language models currently available.</p>
												<p>One of the key features of ChatGPT is its ability to generate human-like text responses to prompts. This makes it useful for a wide range of applications, such as creating chatbots for customer service, generating responses to questions in online forums, or even creating personalized content for social media posts.</p>
												<div class="quotebox">
													<div class="icon">
														<i class="icon-quote-left"></i>
													</div>
													<p>To use ChatGPT, you will need to have access to the OpenAI API. Once you have obtained an API key, you can use the ChatGPT model by sending it a prompt in the form of a text string. The model will then generate a response based on the information it has been trained on.</p>
												</div>
												<p>ChatGPT uses deep learning algorithms to generate text responses to prompts. The model is based on the GPT-3 architecture, which is a type of transformer model that uses self-attention mechanisms to process and generate text.</p>
												<p>The GPT-3 architecture is a type of neural network that is composed of multiple layers of interconnected nodes. Each node in the network is designed to process a specific aspect of the input text, such as the overall meaning, the syntactic structure, or the contextual information. As the input text is passed through the network, the nodes work together to generate a coherent and grammatically correct response.</p>
												<p>The development of the GPT-3 architecture was led by Alec Radford, Jeffrey Wu, Rewon Child, and David Luan, who are all researchers at OpenAI. The team worked closely with a number of other researchers and engineers at OpenAI to develop and train the GPT-3 model on a large corpus of text data.</p>

The celebration continued after CB Insights tagged us as one of the top AI startups in the world. In a sweet moment at the end of the year, TIME named us their Best Invention of 2022 in the apps and software category.</p>
												<p>We introduced apps to search, with over 280 custom applications built right on top of You.com. Each app adds functionality to the core search engine so that you can find summarized information or complete a task. Some are well known, like a weather forecast app. Others summarize forums allowing you to skim the most relevant content and find fast answers. We were the first to incorporate apps like Reddit and TikTok into search.</p>

													<p>In December, we introduced YOU Platform, opening our platform to the world. This allows companies to build low-code apps to meet users on the exact intent of their search, instead of paying Google millions of dollars in ads just to appear on the search page.</p>
												</div>
												<p>To help our users accomplish more, we built AI-powered search apps that provide functionality never before seen inside traditional search engines and established ourselves as a disruptor of both search and science. You can write, code, and create art with YouWrite, YouCode, and YouImagine.</p>
												<p>In the wake of ChatGPT, we became the first in the world to upgrade a large language model for relevance and accuracy and incorporate it into search.
												YouChat, our ChatGPT-like AI search assistant accesses the internet and knows about recent events. It also cites its sources so that you can feel confident in its answers.</p>
												<p>As sites like TikTok became to go-to search engines for younger users, we combed the web and summarized Twitter, Instagram, and Reddit to introduce the Social tab, allowing users to search across 9+ social media sites at once.</p>

												<p class="bigger">It's been a while since we've heard some compelling rumors about the Apple Glasses, with Cupertino's long-rumored augmented reality smart glasses seemingly still some time away from launching. As such, it's looking likely that we will still have a couple of years to wait before they are revealed, with the Apple AR/VR headset likely to launch first.</p>
												<p>Apple Glasses could run on a proprietary operating system first uncovered in the final version of iOS 13; we do like the tipped name of glassOS. The augmented reality framework shows up multiple times in code and text documents, meaning Apple is likely testing activation and application in some capacity. Either way, this is what it'll take for us to wear Apple Glasses. So here's everything else we know so far about Apple Glasses, including the potential release date, price, design and specs. </p>
												<div class="quotebox">
													<div class="icon">
														<i class="icon-quote-left"></i>
													</div>
													<p>A Bloomberg report also corroborated a delay, noting technical challenges involved in making Apple Glasses a reality. So now Apple may be prioritizing a cheaper version of its mixed reality headset, with a possible 2024 or 2025 launch.</p>
												</div>
												<p>In addition to Apple Glass, the Apple VR and mixed reality headset is also in the works, and could be less complex and closer to launch. 
												The Apple VR and mixed reality headset reportedly features ultra-high-resolution screens and a cinematic speaker system that should enable realistic visual experiences, according to people who have seen prototypes. </p>
												<p>Those sources also said the headset looks like a slimmer, fabric-swathed, Oculus Quest, but the design isn't final as the company continues testing to determine the ideal fit for most head shapes.</p>
												<p>Glasses that look like glasses: We would like some natural looking glasses, like the ones in the concepts that you see on this page. Iâ€™m sure that Apple wants the same thing. No one wants AR glasses that look like geek-wear.</p>

												<p class="bigger">Sharing by OpenAI a new version of its so-called. The so-called "Large Language Model" (LLM) called GPT-4 was such a surprise that no one knew exactly when it would happen, although an indicative date was unofficially given. When an update to the model behind his popular ChatGPT was released, everyone was a bit surprised. The authors call GPT-4 their "most advanced system, producing safer and more useful responses." It was designed to be the primary engine powering chatbots and all sorts of other systems, from search engines to personal assistants and online tutors.</p>
												<p>GPT-4 extends the basic capabilities of the ChatGPT software, allowing you to solve more difficult problems with greater accuracy, thanks to a broader general knowledge and skills to deal with high-end challenges. It also introduces new capabilities, primarily the processing of images as input, with detailed recognition of the content of image files, which immediately caused comments about the "end of Internet CAPTCHAs". The new version also allows you to generate captions, classifications and analysis.</p>
												<div class="quotebox">
													<div class="icon">
														<i class="icon-quote-left"></i>
													</div>
													<p>GPT-4 is able to handle text with a volume exceeding 25,000 words, which allows for the generation of extensive content, extensive conversations, as well as searching and analyzing large documents.</p>
												</div>
												<p>OpenAI, which has approximately 375 employees, is backed by billions of dollars of investment from Microsoft and high-profile tech figures. The surprise mentioned at the beginning was also due to the fact that the premiere of GPT-4 was expected to be combined with an event presenting new Microsoft services.</p>
												<p>It is worth noting that the availability of GPT-4 does not mean that it is available in the extremely popular, publicly available, free version of the chatbot.</p>
												<p>To get to know the possibilities of the four, you must be a subscriber to the paid ChatGPT Plus subscription plan. The new model has also been made available as a development API for developers.</p>

												<p class="bigger">Research teams from Germany's Max Planck Institute for medical research and the University of Heidelberg have developed a way to 3D print objects in one "piece" using sound waves. Their technique, which is described in the journal Science Advances, uses profiled ultrasonic waves to create acoustic holograms that exert pressure on the printed material like an invisible form.</p>
												<p>The group used their technique to 3D print objects from micro-beads of hydrogel beads and even biological cells - all completely 'touch free'. As Heiner Kremer, who wrote a program that prints with this technique, explains in the publication on the research, the transition from a 3D model to the working ultrasonic sphere was quite difficult, requiring the use of a custom algorithm.</p>
												<p>Most importantly, the sound waves do not damage cells, which means that no chemical auxiliaries are needed, and consequently the technique can be particularly useful in 3D bioprinting of tissues and cell cultures. Ultrasonic waves can also penetrate deep into tissues, which allows them to be manipulated in a less invasive way.</p>

This service is now available to everyone on a "limited preview" basis. This means that the user has access, for now, to a limited number of queries.</p>
												<p>The company announces that soon access will be extended and unlimited. You can sign up for the waiting list, a Microsoft account is not required, but people with a Microsoft account will be given priority.</p>
												<div class="quotebox">

													<p>Visitors to Bing.com can see demo examples of chat searches that you can try out. Clicking on the questions takes you to the Bing results page with a traditional list of links on the left and a chat box on the right, where the AI-generated answer appears. This is just a demonstration for the visitor at the moment.</p>
												</div>
												<p>Until a user has full access, they will not be able to ask follow-up or clarification questions. Entering your own query now takes you to the traditional Bing search results list, even though the homepage uses the new chat interface.</p>
												<p>As Microsoft representatives said at a presentation for the media, the service is based on a new "next generation" language model called Prometheus, i.e. on another iteration of OPneAI's models, instead of the expected and announced for months GPT-4.</p>
												<p>Compared to how ChatGPT works, Prometheus is supposed to offer responses with improved relevancy, assign responses to specific web links, provide updated information, and improve geolocation. Microsoft representatives also promise to increase the security of queries.</p>

													<p>"The capabilities of conventional displays have reached their peak and are unlikely to improve significantly in the future due to numerous limitations," says Dragomir Neshev, professor of physics at the National University of Australia, in the paper.</p>
												</div>
												<p>"The search for a high-resolution, fast refresh rate all-solid-state flat panel display technology is currently underway. We have designed and developed meta-surface pixels that, unlike liquid crystals, do not require polarized light to function, which will cut the screens' power consumption in half."</p>
												<p>To control individual pixels with high modulation rates, the researchers' demonstration platform uses transparent conductive oxide as an electrically driven heater that can rapidly change the optical properties of silicon metasurface cells, which are a hundred times thinner than liquid crystal cells. The result of this method is a response time of less than one millisecond, which according to the publication is ten times the limit of detection for the human eye.</p>

												<p class="bigger">According to a paper published in Nature Physics, an international team of physicists has successfully manipulated photons, the elementary particles of light, for the first time. Although it may not sound particularly sensational to the layman, physicists describe it as a great quantum breakthrough that opens up huge scientific and technological possibilities.</p>
												<p>While physics is already adept at controlling quantum entangled atoms, achieving the same with light has proven much more difficult. In a new experiment, a team from the University of Sydney and the University of Basel in Switzerland fired a single photon and a pair of bound photons at a quantum dot (an artificially created atom) so that they could measure the immediate time delay between the photon itself and those that were bound.</p>

													</div>
													<p>Stimulated emission and detection of single photons as well as small groups of photons in a single atom was achieved, leading to their strong correlation, in other words 'quantum light'.</p>
												</div>
												<p>'By demonstrating the manipulation of photon bound states, we have taken an important first step towards harnessing quantum light for practical applications,' explains Sahand Mahmoodian of the University of Sydney in a release. The next steps are to use this approach to build better quantum computers.</p>
